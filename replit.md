# BillTracker Pro - Mobile Billing Application

## Overview

BillTracker Pro is a modern mobile-first invoice tracking and billing application built with React, TypeScript, and Express.js. The application provides a comprehensive solution for managing clients, creating invoices, tracking payments, and generating reports through an intuitive mobile interface.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between client and server
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-based session storage

### Mobile-First Design & PWA
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for mobile devices with max-width container
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Large buttons and intuitive navigation
- **Progressive Web App**: Full PWA implementation with offline support
  - Service worker with intelligent caching strategies
  - Web app manifest with app shortcuts
  - Install prompt for home screen addition
  - Offline functionality for cached content

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a relational database structure with the following core entities:

- **Clients**: Customer information (name, email, phone, address)
- **Invoices**: Invoice details with status tracking (draft, sent, paid, overdue)
- **Invoice Items**: Line items for each invoice with quantity, rate, and amounts
- **Payments**: Payment records linked to invoices
- **Settings**: Company configuration and defaults

### API Structure
RESTful API endpoints following conventional patterns:
- `/api/clients` - Client management operations
- `/api/invoices` - Invoice CRUD operations
- `/api/payments` - Payment tracking
- `/api/settings` - Application configuration
- `/api/dashboard/stats` - Dashboard analytics

### Component Architecture
- **Layout System**: Mobile-optimized layout with sticky navigation
- **Page Components**: Dashboard, Clients, Invoices, Reports, Settings
- **UI Components**: Reusable Shadcn/ui components with consistent theming
- **Form Components**: Standardized form handling with validation
- **Modal System**: Dialog-based workflows for creating/editing entities

## Data Flow

1. **Client Request**: User interactions trigger API calls through TanStack Query
2. **API Processing**: Express.js routes handle requests with Zod validation
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
4. **Response Handling**: Server returns JSON responses with error handling
5. **State Updates**: TanStack Query updates client state and triggers re-renders
6. **UI Updates**: React components re-render with new data

### Key Data Patterns
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback with server reconciliation
- **Real-time Sync**: Automatic background data fetching and cache invalidation
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout the application
- **Loading States**: Skeleton components and loading indicators

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL adapter
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Strong typing across the full stack
- **ESBuild**: Fast production bundling for server code
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for Replit environment

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with Node.js 20 runtime
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 module
- **Hot Reload**: Vite development server with HMR
- **Environment Variables**: DATABASE_URL for database connection

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite build outputs static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Deployment**: Autoscale deployment target on Replit
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000, mapped to external port 80

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: `vite build` compiles React application
2. **Backend Build**: `esbuild` bundles Node.js server with external packages
3. **Static Assets**: Frontend assets served from Express.js in production
4. **Database Migrations**: Drizzle Kit manages schema changes
